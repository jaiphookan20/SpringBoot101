Question 3: 

Explain upper bounded wildcards and lower bounded wildcards with an example.

wildcards which are represented by ('?')

Upper bounded wildcards are used to restrict unknown types to a particular type/sub-type of a type. We do this by using the 
‘?’ with 'extends' . It is meant to reduce the total possible restrictions that can occur 

Example:
void addToList(List<? extends Number> numbers)

Lower bounded wildcards: 

Lower bounded wildcards are used to restrict unknown types to a particular type or super-type of a type. We do this by using the '?'
keyword with super keyword

Example:

List<? super Double> list
